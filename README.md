<h1>FUNKOPOPSHOP CAC</h1>

The website has two essential parts:

First, you will have the front side of the page where clients will be able to see the stock products, prices, and features.

Secondly, the website will have a "backoffice" for shop management. This section will allow you to view the list of uploaded products and their stock. You will have the ability to add, edit, and remove items and their properties. Any changes made in the backoffice will be displayed in real time on the client's side.

To build this project, I am going to use the following technologies and development tools:

FIGMA
HTML
CSS (Bootstrap optional)
JavaScript
GIT and GITHUB
Node.js + Express.js
NPM
MVC Architecture
Template Engines
MySQL and database administrators

I have already the design of each part of the website made by FIGMA. Though the challenge is significant, it is not impossible. With the knowledge I will gain from the #CAC bootcamp, I will be able to accomplish it.
