<h1>FUNKOPOPSHOP CAC</h1>


The website have to 2 essential parts:

First, you going to have 
the front side of the page in which the clients are going to be able 
to see the stock products, the prices, and features.

Secondly, the website it's going to have the "backoffice" for the management of the shop,
in order to see the list of products upload and its stock,
with the possibility to add,edit and remove items and its properties, and those changes can be displayde on the client's side in real time.

To build this project, I am going to use this technologies and tools of development:


- FIGMA
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap optional)
- Javascript
- GIT y GITHUB
- Node JS + Express JS
- NPM
- Arquitechture MVC
- Template Engines
- MySQL and DDBB administrators


I have the design of the website made on FIGMA of each part of the website.
The challenge is big but not impossible. Through the knowledge I'm going to have after the #CAC bootcamp,
I'm going to be able to do it.
